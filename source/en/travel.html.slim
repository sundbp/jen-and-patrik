    | Exact locations for the church and Jen's parents' house is available under the #{{link_to('chuch', '/en/church')}} and #{{link_to('dinner', '/en/dinner')}} sections. There's parking available by the church and by Jennifer's parents' house.

  h2 By train

  p
    | The nearest station is Marden. From London trains go from Charing Cross station every 10-30min.

  p
    | To get from Marden station to the church is unfortunately not    walking distance (especially for the ladies in their uncomfortable  heels!). We will find some taxi numbers and post here once we have any. It's not a long taxi journey, my guess is about 10min.

  h2 By plane

  p
    | For people abroad the most convenient airports are Gatwich and Heathrow. It is possible to go to Marden by train, but we're not    sure it's the most practical journey given one still needs transport from the station. If possible I'd recommend trying to pool together and share a rental car.

  p Depending on your feedback we can try to investiage train options further.
