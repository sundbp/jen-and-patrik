  h1 Accomodation

  p There aren't a lot of hotels really close by. There are however plenty of B&B's so for people coming by car there are more choices.

  h2 Dale Hill Hotel and Golf Club

  p This hotel is close to the church and dinner. We have reserved a number of rooms that are available for wedding guests.

  p We've managed to reserve the following rooms at slighly better than stock prices. First to sign up applies.

  ul
    li 3 double rooms, 110 GBP/night
    li 2 twin bed rooms, 110 GBP/night
    li 2 small double rooms, 110 GBP/night
    li 2 double rooms with golf course view, 130 GBP/night

  p Prices include breakfast. Extra beds for kids can be arranged.

  p When reserving your room with Dale Hill please reference it's for the wedding arranged by Antony and Sylvia Harris.

  p I think you can book rooms also outside of those 10 rooms, but I'm not sure about prices.

  p If you have trouble finding accomodation please get in touch and we'll try to find more alternatives.

In general Google is your friend and there are several websites liks this one available to assist: #{{link_to('http://www.britainsfinest.co.uk/bedandbreakfast', 'http://www.britainsfinest.co.uk/bedandbreakfast')}}

  h2 Tunbridge Wells

  p The closest town is Tunbridge Wells, about 25-30min away by car.

  p Tunbridge Wells has several hotels, but having had a look around we'd recommend B&B's as a better alternative. It is however available if you have a hard time finding a room.
