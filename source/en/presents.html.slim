    h1 Presents / Wedding List

    p As we are not setting up our home at the moment we have chosen to not have a "traditional" wedding list. However,
      | we know that many of you have been asking for gift ideas.

    p For us, the greatest gift is to have your friendship and to have you join us on our wedding day,
      | we wish for nothing more. If you do however wish to bring a gift we would be thrilled with something
      | modest and personal of your choosing that we can remember you by for the rest or our lives together.

    p Looking forward to seeing you in July!
