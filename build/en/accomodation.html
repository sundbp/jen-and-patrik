          <h1>Accomodation</h1>
          <p>There aren't a lot of hotels really close by. There are however plenty of B&B's.
            To simplify the logistics for people without cars we'd recommend people to get
            in touch with us and we can help organize rooms that are clustered together
            and hence easier to sort out transport for.</p>
          <p>We currently have 5-10 rooms at a few B&B's reserved. We can allocate
            those to people and if not enough help in finding more. Send us an email or
            give us a call and we'll help you out.</p>
          <h2>Bed and Breakfasts</h2>
          <p>There are plenty of B&B's in the area of all price ranges and standards. If you are driving your
            own car there's quite a few within reasonable driving distance. However, if you're hoping to
            get a ride back at the end of the Saturday we'd recommend you get in touch with us about bookings
            so that we can coordinate people along a sensible route for transport home at the end of the evening.</p>
          <p>This is a list of nearby alternatives: <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/106jwNp1GZSypJdzosYWtEOkkn0VNDJkGwHqCMVoWqMk/edit">Nearby B&Bs</a>.
            We have already reserved rooms in a few of these B&B's so you may want to get in touch with us if you're
            thinking of booking a B&B.</p>
          <h2>Tunbridge Wells</h2>
          <p>The closest town is Tunbridge Wells, about 25-30min away by car.</p>
          <p>Tunbridge Wells has several hotels, but having had a look around we'd recommend B&B's as a better alternative,
            there are only 1 or 2 decent hotels and those are pretty fully booked. It is however available as an alternative.</p>
          <h2>Dale Hill Hotel and Golf Club</h2>
          <strong>UPDATE: NO MORE ROOMS AVAILABLE.</strong>
